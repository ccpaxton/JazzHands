if (it is RHOS)
  cat jazzhands-universal.yaml | sed 's/PLATFORM_TAG_HERE/OpenShift/g' | oc apply -f -


IKS FILE
Removed comment line above Service definition from IKS (not in RHOS file)
Removed "annotations:" from IKS  (nothing was defined)
Removed "externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster" from IKS (not in RHOS file and per https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/ the Cluster setting is DEFAULT)
Removed "sessionAffinity: None" from IKS (per https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/  None is DEFAULT)
Removed "status:
  loadBalancer: {}" from IKS

RHOS FILE
Changed Service name to "name: jazzhands-lb-svc" in RHOS (to be consistent with IKS)
Removed  "loadBalancerIP:" from RHOS file (necessary?  It doesn't have a value, so no?)
